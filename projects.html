										<b>Devour Power</b> is a website developed for SB Hacks III at UC Santa Barbara. The app was entered into the best use of AWS, best use of the Esri API, and the best domain name. The app won best domain name. The project was created to address the growing issue of food waste in the United States. Our team decided to tackle this problem by creating a service where food pantries or restaurants can say how much they have left over or need, then their location and inventory/need is plotted on a map. The goal of the app is to have hungry people get food that would have gone to waste otherwise. We have accounts from people who have worked at food places on campus of UC Santa Barbara throwing out food everynight due to regulations stating that they have to, even though the food is still perfectly edible. I was the sole Android developer for this project. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/devour-power">Click here for the Devpost which includes a link to the Github repo.</a>
